//! A single-producer, single-consumer, futures-aware channel
//!
//! A channel can be used as a communication primitive between tasks running on
//! `futures-rs` executors. Channel creation provides `Receiver` and `Sender`
//! handles. `Receiver` implements `Stream` and allows a task to read values
//! out of the channel. If there is no message to read from the channel, the
//! curernt task will be notified when a new value is sent. `Sender` implements
//! the `Sink` trait and allows a task to send messages into the channel. If
//! the channel is at capacity, then send will be rejected and the task will be
//! notified when additional capacity is available.
//!
//! # Disconnection
//!
//! When all `Sender` handles have been dropped, it is no longer possible to
//! send values into the channel. This is considered the termination event of
//! the stream. As such, `Sender::poll` will return `Ok(Ready(None))`.
//!
//! If the receiver handle is dropped, then messages can no longer be read out
//! of the channel. In this case, a `send` will result in an error.
//!
//! # Clean Shutdown
//!
//! If the `Receiver` is simply dropped, then it is possible for there to be
//! messages still in the channel that will not be processed. As such, it is
//! usually desirable to perform a "clean" shutdown. To do this, the receiver
//! will first call `close`, which will prevent any further messages to be sent
//! into the channel. Then, the receiver consumes the channel to completion, at
//! which point the receiver can be dropped.
