//! Asynchronous channels.
//!
//! Like threads, concurrent tasks sometimes need to communicate with each
//! other. This module contains two basic abstractions for doing so:
//!
//! - [oneshot], a way of sending a single value from one task to another.
//! - [mpsc], a multi-producer, single-consumer channel for sending values
//!   between tasks, analogous to the similarly-named structure in the standard
//!   library.
//!
//! All items are only available when the `std` or `alloc` feature of this
//! library is activated, and it is activated by default.
